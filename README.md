# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

The latest prototype from AutosRUs, the MechaCar, is facing production challenges that are hindering the progress of the manufacturing team. The objective of this analysis is to examine the production data to uncover insights that could assist the manufacturing team in overcoming these obstacles.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
From the output, some variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are `vehicle_length` and `ground_clearance`.

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, as some of the independent variables have significant p-values.

This linear model can predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively, as the r-squared value is relatively high, suggesting that the model accounts for a significant portion of the variance in the dependent variable (mpg).
